VIM plugin for finding common language errors
=============================================

Writing prose is tedious and as soon as it gets more complex than finding
spelling errors, the task of correcting mistakes can hardly be automated.

Heuristics can help, though. This plugin takes Matt Might's recommendations
from his blog (XXX URL) and translates his shell script heuristics into
Vim script.
