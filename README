VIM plugin for finding common language errors
=============================================

Writing prose is tedious and as soon as it gets more complex than finding
spelling errors, the task of correcting mistakes can hardly be automated.

Heuristics can help, though. This plugin takes Matt Might's recommendations
from his blog [1] and translates his shell script heuristics into Vim script.

USAGE
-----
Simple: Have a document (txt, latex, ...) open and call s:WeaselFunc(). By
default this call is mapped to <Leader-w>, which is '\'+w in my case. The
plugin then parses all your text (yes, this may take some time) and generates
a quickfix window containing all locations where it found something notable.

TODO
----
* can we also incorporate Michael Hohmuth's checkbiw?
